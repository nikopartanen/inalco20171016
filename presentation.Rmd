## Background

- I started working with Komi language in 2011
- After my MA in University of Helsinki in 2013 I worked in Germany and now in Paris
   - Some work in Germany not related to my PhD
- In 2014--2016 there was a project working with one Komi dialect
- For 2017--2019 we got a continuation project


## My dissertation

- Topic of my PhD is variation in Komi dialects
    - Relates to language contact, partly sociolinguistically motivated
    - Deliminated by … 
        - … what we can say with existing data
        - … what kind of annotations we can realistically add
        - … which processes can be automatized with sufficient quality
        - … etc

## Talk's structure

- What's Komi language?
- Outcome of IKDP project
- Plans for the IKDP2 project
- Work done in Paris
- Current state of my PhD (vague deadline is in 2019)
    - Russian influence in Komi
    - Phonetic changes
    - Morphosyntactic changes
    - Better analysis of syntactic structures should follow

## Komi language

- Uralic language
- Three varieties: Komi-Zyrian, Komi-Permyak, Komi-Jazva
- Closely related to Udmurt, more distantly to Finnish, Hungarian etc.
- Around 300,000 speakers, everyone bilingual in Russian
- Spoken by children in several regions
- Language shift in the cities fast

## Dialects

- Historical expansion from south to north
- Around 10-14 varieties, each splitting to few subvarieties
- Areal spread related to the river systems
- Written language based to central Syktyvkar dialect
    - Often exhibits dialectal features
- Komi-Zyrian and Komi-Permyak mutually intelligible 
- Official support of Komi-Zyrian much wider than Komi-Permyak's
- Komi-Jazva under-researched and seriously endangered, some materials exist in Russian institutions in Perm and Syktyvkar

## IKDP

- The project aimed to produce generally useful dataset from Iźva dialect
    - Not built with individual research question in mind
    - Tries to be areally and demographically (little bit) balanced
- Fieldwork in four locations, covering most of the areas except Siberia
- Results in almost 300,000 transcribed words
- Lots of focus in metadata and systematizing old data

## Annotation model

- Unusually for a language documentation project, the annotations were shallow
- As far as was possible, the English or Russian translations were provided
- Rather large percentage of utterances are in Russian, or contain different Russian segments
- This is not to say that we don't need the annotations!

## Other sources

- The availibity of Komi materials has been growing also otherwise
- Fenno-Ugria collection has produced thousands of digitalized books and newspaper (Red Pechora etc.)
- Marina Fedina's [laboratory](http://fu-lab.ru/) in Syktyvkar has been proofreading and digitalizing books
- Some online corpora exist as well
- Restructuring old materials is a never ending task
    - One way to fill gaps in current data

## Corpus structure

### Original layers

- Time aligned transcriptions
- Raw data, regularly adds into transcriptions

### Subcorpora

- Manually corrected phoneme-aligned utterances 
- Manually annotated syntactic dependencies
- Semi-manually annotated POS-tagged subcorpus


## Language technology

- Forced alignation to match phonemes and utterances
- Automatic segmentation tools to get materials transcribed faster
- Morphological and syntactic annotations
    - Rule-based analysators
    - Statistical SEM parser
    - Machine learning based [Multilingual Bist-parser](https://github.com/jujbob/multilingual-bist-parser)

## Niko's PhD

- Majority of Iźva Komi's expansion has taken place in last 200 years
    - Komis settled to Muži in 1843, to Kola Peninsula in 1880s 
- Internal variety in the dialect must be relatively new
- Usually connects to geographic isolation and/or language contact


- Phonetic differences easiest to access as the existing annotation layer captures those partially
- Within morphology there are differences in frequencies of allomorphs
- We assume there is quite much syntactic variation


- Current studies have also been test cases for the corpus -> used to select new materials

## Topic: Russian influence in Komi

- Already studied, but there have not been corpus based investigations [@leinonen2009a]
- My recent work has discussed this from:
    - Adaptation of Russian phonology
    - Morphological changes and patterns 
    - Word order changes
        - Especially written and spoken Komi differ in this
        - There are syntactic structures in Komi, which prefer OV construction although usually the word order is described as SVO
- As contact has been so long, the way borrowing takes place has strongly conventionalized

## Permic sibilant system

```{r, echo=FALSE}
sibs <- tibble::tibble(voiceless = c('s', 'ɕ', 'ʃ'),
       voiced = c('z', 'ʑ', 'ʒ'))
  
suppressWarnings(row.names(sibs) <- c('alveolar', 'alveolo-palatal', 'palato-alveolar'))

sibs %>% knitr::kable()
```

## Current dialectal sibilant system

```{r, echo=FALSE}
sibs <- tibble(voiceless = c('s', 'sʲ', 'ʃ'),
       voiced = c('z', 'zʲ', 'ʒ'))
  
suppressWarnings(row.names(sibs) <- c('alveolar', 'alveolar (palatalized)', 'palato-alveolar'))

sibs %>% knitr::kable()

```

##

- Similar development in numerous dialects
    - Upper Sysola
    - Ińva (Komi-Permyak)
    - All have exceptionally long or intensive contact with Russian

- In Iźva (roughly) areally restricted to Siberia, Kola Peninsula, Kanin Peninsula
- Co-occurs and overlaps with other developments inside Iźva (parallels in other dialects)
    - Deaffricatization, metathesis etc.

## EMU-system

- Uses segmentation tools developed in [Institute of Phonetics and Speech Processing of the University of Munich](http://ips-lmu.github.io/)
- Has existing models for Russian segmentation
- Can be accessed through [emuR R package](http://ips-lmu.github.io/EMU.html)
- I've used it through a simple mapping between Komi and Russian phoneme inventories
    - Doesn't come without problems

- I'm currently analysing the phonetic properties of these sibilants
- The standard pronunciation on some area
- Associated with Russian
- I use the information about Russian origin of the lexical item as one variable


- The core Izhma area lacks many features that are common on tundra areas
- However, the local reindeer herders do exhibit these in their speech
- This feature is **not** among these ones

## Example from morphological variation

- Verbs in past tense can occur with several allomorphs
    - isny ~ isnys ~ iny ~ inys
    - Example: мунісны ~ мунісныс ~ муніны ~ муніныс
- To some degree areal, but variation present in many dialects
- Iźva is possibly the only dialect with all four variants in use
- Ideas to test: transitivity, presence of object, phonotaxis, syllable stress, age-graded variation, register choices, sociolinguistic differences etc.
- Current descriptions of Komi are good, but there are gaps

## Multilingual Bist-parser

- Developed mainly by KyungTae Lim, based on a monolingual parser [@limEtAl2017a]
- We have experimented with combining Russian and Finnish corpora into training models that are applied to Komi data
    - Results have been promising
    - For now the Finnish model has outperformed the others

- Possibly especially useful with data that contains both Russian and Komi
- Other approach is to do language identification beforehand
